# Rasha Movie Project

## Part 1 - Development

### 1.1 Overview
The objective of this project is to create a Java web application using the Spring Framework. It's designed to retrieve detailed information about movies and determine if they have won the "Best Picture" Oscar, using data from an API and a CSV file of Oscar winners from 1935 to 2010.

### 1.2 Solution
The application is built in a supported version of Java with a production-ready, well-structured design. The solution is clear and understandable for developers, colleagues, or customers.

### 1.3 Requirements
The application includes a REST API for persisting and retrieving data from a real database.

### 1.4 Development Information
Development involves using the OMBD Movies API and a CSV file of Oscar winners from 1927 to 2010.

## Part 2 - Technical Design Document

### 2.1 Overview
In addition to development, a comprehensive Technical Design Document is required for a movie 'rating' feature. This feature allows users to rate movies and provides a list of the top ten rated movies.

### 2.2 Solution
The design document outlines the approach, thought process, and steps for future development and scalability of the rating feature. It addresses the MVP's initial aspects and the necessary steps to scale the application for a potential user base of millions.
